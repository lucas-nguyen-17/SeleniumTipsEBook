This document helps any SDET who is experienced in writing test code with Se-Webdriver in Java. And it may not help if you’re a quite beginner in test automation.
The below tips are written in Java so I expect that you have fair knowledge on Java programming. 
The document covers various topics starting from Java 8 streams, design patterns, Inheritance vs Composition and selenium webdriver code snippets.  Some of the code snippets below are written in both with & without streams, so the reader can understand the power of streams well.
I brought in a lot of UI automation problems in this document and transformed them as tips.

Happy Reading!!
