# SeleniumWebdriver e-Book 

## Preface
- The following pointers/tricks are written based on my experience with Java+Selenium web driver. And few pointers I learnt from reading Selenium Web driver books. I have applied these tips successfully in my job.

- This document helps any SDET(Software Developer Engineer Test) who is experienced in writing test code with Se-Webdriver.
- The below tips are written in Java so I expect that readers knows Core Java.
- The document covers various topics starting from Java 8 streams, design patterns, Inheritance vs Composition and selenium webdriver code snippets.  Some of the code snippets below are written in both with & without streams, so the reader can understand the power of streams well.
I brought in a lot of UI automation problems in this document and transformed them as tips.
